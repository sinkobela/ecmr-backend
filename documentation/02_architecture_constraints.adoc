== Architecture Constraints

Various constraints are respected for the design of a *eCMR*.
They all affect the solution.
We list these restrictions and explain their motivations.
Some of the constraints go beyond individual *eCMR* and are valid for whole the platform or organization.

=== Technical Constraints

The following technical constraints apply:

.Technical constraints
[cols="0h,3,5"]
|===
| Id   | Constraint                                            | Value/Description

| BSD3 | Basic Stack for Development: programming langues      | Programming Languages: Java
| BSD5 | Basic Stack for Development: other                    | All other technologies must be compatible with OKD/Kubernetes
| BC1  | Continuous Integration Pipeline constraints           | Integrated with the GitLab CI Runner
| BC2  | Project License                                       | Developed under an open-source license [Open Logistics Foundation License 1.3]
| BC3  | Requirements at libraries                             | Only libraries under a Copy-Left free Open Source License can be used. Accepted open source licenses are, among others, *Apache License 2.0, MIT License, BSD License*
| BC4  | Libraries constraints                                 | Frameworks & libraries under an open-source license (such as GPL, LGPL) are restricted by the use of the open source license [Open Logistics Foundation License 1.3]

=== Organizational Constraints

The following organizational constraints apply:

.Organizational constraints
[cols="0h,0h,"]
|===
| Id | Constraint | Background and / or Motivation

| O1 | Schedule   | Milestones:

04/2021 completion of Version 0.1 for eCMR

| O2 | Parts         |
| O3 | Process model | Development, agile/Scrum. To describe the architecture arc42 is used.
| O4 | Development tools |

Java source code created in IntelliJ.
| O5 | Configuration management      | Git at GitLab hosted by Open Logistics Foundation
| O6 | Test tools and test processes | Unit testing as part of a CI/CD Pipeline (stage test)

Java based components: SpringBootTest

| O7 | Other tools | Maven 3.8.6 for Build Management

Spring Boot 3.2.4 as Application Framework (Java)

Java 17

=== Political Constraints

The following political constraints apply:

.Political constraints
[cols="0h,1,2"]
|===
| Id | Constraint                       | Background and / or Motivation

| P1 | Release as Open Source           | The source code of the solution is made available as open source. License: link:../LICENSE[Open Logistics FoundationLicense 1.3], Hosted by [Open Logistics Foundation]
| P2 | All dependencies are Open Source | A complete list of (transitive) dependencies and their Open Source licences needs to be provided
