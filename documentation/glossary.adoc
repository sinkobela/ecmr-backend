The United Nations Trade Data Element Directory (UNTDED, ISO 7372) is developed and published by UN/CEFACT. The directory consists of a four-digit number to identify each data element, a data element name, and a description that provides a definition of the data element. It provides an internationally accepted standard repository for the semantic of trade data elements used in international trade.
